# minesweeper
Minesweeper application developed using .NET MAUI cross-platform framework.

## Notes
Minesweeper game developed during early days of learning how to code at university.

Minesweeper-old is the initial WinForms C++ project which is no longer compatible with latest Visual Studio versions.
It works though if is imported into brand new Visual Studio C++ WinForms project and main classes are copied over and Resources re-imported.
Left in history as initial version before rewrite and as a reference implementation (not the cleanest code but fine).
